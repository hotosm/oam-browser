OpenAerialMap (OAM) is a collection of openly licensed satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. OAM is an open service that will provide storage and serach of this imagery. Below is an introductory on how to use OAM. 

How to use? 
===========

OAM can be used with a web browser. Simply search by location to find imagery available in a given area of interest. Each area can be selected to view available imagery as well as details about each image. 

The OAM search interface focuses on two main core functions: 
  
  1. Searching by location and metadata
  2. Using available imagery

OAM can be used within any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE 10+). Older versions of Internet Explorer may have limited functionality and are not fully supported. 

Searching by location
=====================

When first visiting the application, initial search can be accomplished by typing the location of an area into the search box or selecting the Browse Latest Imagery button. Browse Latest Imagery will take you to the most recently collected imagery available in the catalog.
